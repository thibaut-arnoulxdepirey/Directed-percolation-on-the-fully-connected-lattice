# Directed-percolation-on-the-fully-connected-lattice
This repository contains python codes for simulating the single-species directed percolation on the fully connected lattice. It was used to make Fig. (5) and Fig. (6) of the Supplemental Material of "Self-organized criticality in complex model ecosystems". 

The file 'Code--Single site.ipynb' contains a solver for Eq. (12) of the Supplemental Material, and solves the saddle-point single-site equations of motion Eq. (11). The corresponding two-time correlation function is computed. 

The file 'Code--Fully connected.ipynb' implements Eq. (7) of the Supplemental Material. The outcome is the two-time correlation function of the total population size, matching the analytical scaling form derived in Eq. (20) of the Supplemental Material.
