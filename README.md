# Directed-percolation-on-the-fully-connected-lattice
This repository contains python code for the simulation of single-species directed percolation on the fully connected lattice. It was used to make Fig. (5) and Fig. (6) of the Supplemental Material of "Self-organized criticality in complex model ecosystems".
